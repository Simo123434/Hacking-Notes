# Command and Control Framework structure

boils down to a giant netcat listener that can handle many reverse shells 
a c2 framework require a special payload generator e.g msfvenom for metasploit

### Command and Control Structure 

C2 server:
Hub for all agents to call home to. Agents will reach out home every so oftern and await commands

Beacons is a process where the agent calls back to the main C2 server

### Obfuscating Agent callbacks

sleep timers can be identified by security analysts and they can determine they have been infected
By adding jitter to the sleep time, makes the traffic seem normal and harder to be detected

### Payload Types

Stageless payloads include the C2 agent and once run begin to beacon
Staged payloads only use a dropper which then calls back to the C2 server to download the full agent and then beaconing begins
staged payloads are the preferred as they are smaller and easier to obfuscate

### Payload formats

Many payload formats like ps1 scripts, HTA, JScript, Vb, Office and more 

## Questions
1.  What is the component's name that lives on the victim machine that calls back to the C2 server? 
	- ***Agent*
2. What is the beaconing option that introduces a random delay value to the sleep timer?
	- ***Jitter*
3. What is the term for the first portion of a Staged payload?
	- ***Dropper*
4. What is the name of the communication method that can potentially allow access to a restricted network segment that communicates via TCP ports 139 and 445?
	- ***SMB beacon*
